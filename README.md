# Power-analysis-for-fMRI-studies
Here, you can find useful materials and links to conduct power analyses and calculate sample sizes for fMRI studies.


##  Let's start with some relevant papers: 
Some of them focus on power analysis in general, while the majority are specific to fMRI studies.

- [How many participants do we have to include in properly powered experiments? A tutorial of power analysis with reference tables (M. Brysbaert 2019)](https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.72/)
- [A power calculation guide for fMRI studies (J. Mumford 2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427872/)
- [Sample size evolution in neuroimaging research: An evaluation of highly-cited studies (1990–2012) and of latest practices (2017–2018) in high-impact journals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920306509)
- [Small sample sizes reduce the replicability of task-based fMRI studies (Turner et al., 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0073-z)
- [fMRI replicability depends upon sufficient individual-level data (Derek Evan Nee, 2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0378-6)
- [Reply to: fMRI replicability depends upon sufficient individual-level data (Turner et al., 2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0379-5)
- [Setting sample size using cost efficiency in fMRI studies(Guo et al., 2012)](http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=12772)
- [An empirical investigation into the number of subjects required for an event-related fMRI study (Murphy and Garavan 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811904000977?via%3Dihub)

## Here are some videos and more interactive material:
- Video of [Mumford talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR2CrzWKFVE)
- [Slides from Mumford class](https://courses.lsa.umich.edu/fmri-training-course/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2019/08/4_tuesday_power.pdf)
- From the [Andy’s brain blog](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/andysbrainblog/tag/statistics)
- From [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/improving-statistical-questions/lecture-3-2-power-analysis-4ZaNz) (short video on power analysis in general not MRI specific) 
- [Slides from Nichole Lighthall](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.usc.edu/dist/1/803/files/2013/06/Nicholes_powerpoint.pdf) (April 2012) 
- Videos (2h30) from Cimec [Think OpenRovereto Symposium: Power analysis for neuroimaging](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=Gl7i3awmfls&list=PLiX54geLkpPJOtuvyOQ_K4qO_s5MnC42h&index=11)

## I want to highlight this tool developed in the Department of Statistical Analysis at UGent.
- The tool is available [here](http://neuropowertools.org/)
- The paper can be found [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/049429v1)

## A useful webpage where a list of online tools and more material about the topic is collected.
Interesting [webpage](https://brainpower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on power calculation for brain studies
